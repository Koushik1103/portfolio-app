            Hey, I'm Koushik, just a computer science and engineering student
            cruising through the wild ride of the third year in a four-year
            journey. ðŸš€ I'm your go-to backend developer, turning code into
            magic. When I'm not geeking out over lines of code, you'll catch me
            in the virtual worlds of Resident Evil and Call of Duty â€“ absolute
            classics, right? I also kick back with some badminton to keep things
            interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond that, I'm a total tech junkie. I can spend hours glued to
            gadget reviews, always chasing the latest and coolest tech trends.
            Originally from the lively city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, India,
            I've been a local forever. ðŸŒ†
          </p>
